            <p class="info">Once it was determined that her condition was incurable, she requested to remain in the Sanitorium as a custodian and initiated a retreat into herself. She began attending mass daily in the attached Chapel of the Goddess, staying long after the service had ended, improvising an increasingly unintelligible private liturgy. The core of the Sanitorium was acting on her, detaching her from reality, drawing her into limbo. When the Great Combustion came, she barely noticed. People disappeared. Had she invented them? Sometimes they came back. She couldn’t tell if she was dreaming. She prayed constantly, thanking the Goddess for the wisdom granted by the brutal anchorage of her physical person. But what wisdom was that? Then, one day, the morning work-bell didn’t ring. She waited for it in the basement. She waited a long time.
